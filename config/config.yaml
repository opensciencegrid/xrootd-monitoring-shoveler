# Directory to store overflow of queue onto disk.
# The queue keeps 100 messages in memory.  If the shoveler is disconnected from the message bus,
# it will store messages over the 100 in memory onto disk into this directory.  Once the connection has been re-established
# the queue will be emptied.  The queue on disk is persistent between restarts, so a persistent directory should be used.

# Mapping configuration
# If map.all is set, all messages will be mapped to the configured origin.
# For example, with the configuration
# map:
#   all: 172.0.0.4
# If a packet comes in with the private ip address of 192.168.0.4, the packet origin will be changed to 172.0.0.4
# The port is always preserved.
# If you want multiple mappings, you can specify multiple map entries.
# For example, with the configuration
# map:
#   192.168.0.5: 172.0.0.5
#   192.168.0.6: 129.93.10.7
